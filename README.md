# Lightweight and Dynamic Deblurring for IoT enabled Smart Cameras

### Abstract
[Paper reference](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9776515)

Tensorflow implementaion of **"Lightweight and Dynamic Deblurring for IoT-enabled Smart Cameras"** which is published on IEEE Internet of Things Journal by Ju-Wei, Que. 

This repo including speed-oriented & quality-oriented image deblurring models for usage. <br>
According to loss functions composition, Direct-mapping type & GAN-based type are introduced.
  - Speed-oriented model
